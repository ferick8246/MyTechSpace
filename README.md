## Description

I have build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. I build this site completely from scratch and deployed it to Heroku. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installations

You will need to install fallowing 
* MySQL
* Inquirer 
* Sequelize
* Express-handlebars
* Dotenv package

## Usage

Being able to publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions.
